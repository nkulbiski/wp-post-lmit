# WordPress plugin postlimit

A plugin to limit the number of posts per user.

## Details
This plugin adds a section to the user admin screen that allows a limit on posts to be set. 
If a limit is set then that user will be unable to add posts beyond that limit.
Once going over the limit the links to add new posts will be hidden and any direct attempt to add a post will be prevented.
A user will be shown an admin message when they have gone over their limit.
